Hi! My name is Aquib **/aakeb/**. I work as a full-stack web developer at <a href="http://intergen.co.nz" target="_blank">Intergen.</a> While I often get my hands dirty with server-side work, I like to think of myself as leaning more towards the frontend on the spectrum of full-stack developers.

The purpose of this blog is to write about the cool things I've made or found as well as detail the problems I faced along the way so I can come back in a few years to see ~~how much of an idiot I was~~ how far along I've come. Saying that, I'll probably end up spending more time working on the layout and adding features to <a href="https://github.com/aquibm/aquibm-blog" target="_blank">this static blog</a> rather than actually posting much. I will try to make an effort though :)
